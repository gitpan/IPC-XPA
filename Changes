Revision history for Perl extension IPC::XPA.

0.05  Fri Sep  8 20:54:43 EDT 2000
        - missing typemap cast caused warnings from gcc  

	- removed AUTOLOAD stuff; not needed

        - revamped returns from _Set() and _Get(); these now return
	  a hash keyed off of the server name (as returned by XPA),
	  with values being hashes with the returned results.
	  previously it returned an array of the hashes with returned
	  results.  THIS IS A MAJOR API CHANGE and WILL BREAK CODE.

	- the XPA handle had been blessed into IPC::XPA, but the
  	  IPC::XPA::DESTROY routine was set up to handle what
	  IPC::XPA::new created, namely a hash, not a scalar.  Thus,
	  when Perl cleanup was going on, it called DESTROY on the
	  scalar, causing it to burp.  To solve this, the XPA handle is
	  now in it's own class, IPC::XPA::RAW.

        - test script set max_servers to -1 when no servers were
          there, causing _Get to try to allocate that many things.

	- added check for version of ds9; older versions apparantly
	  don't do array correctly.  really shouldn't be using ds9 for
	  testing!

0.03  Thu May 11 13:51:01 EDT 2000
	- nullXPA() was was returning something which caused
	  the XS routines to complain about undef'd values.  it was
	  moved into XS land, and a more sophisticated (kludgy?)
	  thing was done to check for undef and mapping it correctly
	  to NULL.

0.02  Tue May  9 16:58:56 EDT 2000
	- fixed test script to work if more than one server is running

0.01  Wed Apr 19 13:40:48 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
