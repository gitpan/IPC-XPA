NAME

    IPC::XPA - Interface to the XPA messaging system


DESCRIPTION

    IPC::XPA is an interface to the xpa library developed by the
    Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's High Energy Astrophysics
    R&D Group.  The library provides simple inter-process
    communication via calls to the C<xpa> library as well as via
    supplied user land programs.

    For details on what the library offers, as well as the library
    itself, please refer to

	http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/xpa/


    This release provides an interface to most of the client side
    routines.  Eventually the rest will be provided.


DEPENDENCIES

    You will need the XPA library (mentioned above), as well
    as the following perl packages:

       Test::More
       Data::Dumper
       PDL (supported, but not necessary)

INSTALLATION

    You will need to edit Makefile.PL to point to the xpa library and
    includes.

    To perform the tests, you'll need ds9 and xpans running.  ds9 is
    available from

	http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/

    xpans is part of the xpa package.  note that ds9 will
    automatically start xpans if it's in your path.

    If you've got PDL, the test will use that to send an image to ds9.

    To compile, test and install IPC::XPA,

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
